            <li>(3100 BC--> 1492) Cuba is inhabited by diffrent groups of indegenous people, first the Guanajatabey. Later driven to the west part of the island after the arrival of Taíno and Ciboney migrants. </li>
            <li>(1492-1513) on Sunday October 28 1492 Christopher Colombus arrives in Cuba on his first voyage to the americas. in 1511  Diego Velázquez begins the conquest of Cuba and establishes the first settlement "Baracoa" in Cuba.  Year 1513 Spain issued the "encomienda" decree which was a labour system that meant if you conquer non christian people they become your labour. With this comes the first record of slavery in cuba. The landowner Amador de Lares gets permission to bring four African slaves into Cuba. The coming three years most of the indegenous people are slaughtered by either the Spanish or the diseases they brought.  </li>
            <li>(1514-1838) The massacre of indigenous Cubans meant they needed to get new slave-labour for the sugar and tobacco plantations. Around 8000 mostly west African slaves was then shipped to Cuba to work on the plantations in the beginning of the 1500. This number grew steadily as the Cuban sugar industry grew and by 1838 they were close to 400.000 slaves on Cuba and approximetly 800,000 people had been kidnapped and forced to be slaves on cuba since the 1500s. Up to 100,000 of them came illegaly after Spain agreed to abolish slavery in exchange for a payment from London. Under Spains rule Cuba was also attacked many times and Spain even lost Havanna to Great Britain during the seven year's war (1756-1763) under Britains rule there was also a surge of new slaves. Great Britain returned it to spain due to pressure form London sugar merchents fearing it would damage the sugar prices. </li>
            <li>(1868-1902) The first out of three wars fought for Cuban independence begins with the ten year's war from 1868-1878. In 1868 10th of October (now a national holiday called "Grito de Yara") Carlos Manuel de Céspedes freed his slaves and led a uprising for Cuban independence. In 1879 the secound war for independence started with minor succes before defeat in 1880 six years later slavery was also abolished in Cuba. The last war, also known as "Cuban war for independence" stared in 1895 led by poet Jose Martí and Maximo Gomez with the "Manifesto of Montecristi" with the policy of the war. The first two policys being that the war should be waged by black and white people alike, and that the participation of all black people were crucial for victory. The war ended with help from the US who joined the conflict against spain the last three months of the 3 year war. After the war USA becomes protectorate of Cuba and Cuba doesn't gain independence until 1902 with guantanamo bay being leased to the USA. </li> 
            <li>(1906-2016) A rebilion is led by Jose Gomez but USA intervenes and takes control and Gerado Machado becomes establishes dictatorship in Cuba. Later in 1933 Machado is overthrown and goverment reforms such as right to vote for women, minimum wage are instituted even the 8 hour work week long before most countries. Fulgencio Batista a USA backed dictator took control from 1952 to 1959 when he was overthrown by Fidel Castro during the Cuban revolution causing a feud between the USA and Cuba that still exsist today. Fidel served as prime minister and later president until 2008 when his brother Raúl Castro took over. </li>
